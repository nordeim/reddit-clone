# my-pi-agent

An opinionated customization bundle for the [Pi Agent](https://github.com/nordeim/my-pi-agent) — themes, in-tree extensions, a curated 223-skill library, and the supporting docs an agent needs to bootstrap a fresh Pi installation into a productive engineering setup.

This setup is fairly opinionated. It:

- sets up GitHub Dark Default as the theme
- adds Firecrawl tools for searching and scraping
- updates the bottom bar to show the info the maintainer actually cares about
- adds background terminals + UI to manage them
- adds subagents to Pi
- adds workflows to Pi
- adds an ask-user tool that lets the model ask multiple-choice questions
- adds first-class `fd` (file discovery) and `rg` (content search) tools

## What's in the box 

| Area | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Pi setup | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.env.example` | Runtime config, dependency manifest, env-var template for the Pi shell itself. |
| Extensions | `extensions/` | Twelve TypeScript extensions that plug into the Pi agent loop (see below). |
| Skills | `skills/` | 223 self-contained skill packages across 10 categories — the bulk of the repo by file count. Each skill ships a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `metadata.description`, `license`) plus optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `scenes/`, `routes/`, or `engines/` subdirectories loaded on demand. See [`skills-inventory.md`](skills-inventory.md) for a full per-skill breakdown. |
| Themes | `themes/` | `github-dark-default.json` and `brutalist.json` — Pi UI color themes. |
| Git config | `git/` | Project-local gitignore patterns. |
| Assets | `assets/` | Screenshots referenced by this README. |
| Docs | `SETUP.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, `Translation_Engine_v10_APPEND_SYSTEM.md` | Setup runbook, agent-onboarding brief, and system-prompt append layers. |

## Skills catalog

The skill library lives under `skills/` and is indexed by [`skills/skills-catalog.md`](skills/skills-catalog.md) — a single-file directory of all 223 skills with a one-line description and "when to use it" hint for each. The catalog is organized into 10 categories:

Each skill folder contains a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `metadata.description`, `license`) and the full workflow instructions. Most skills also ship `references/`, `scripts/`, or `scenes/` subdirectories that the `SKILL.md` loads on demand.

## Extensions

Twelve TypeScript extensions under `extensions/` extend the Pi agent loop. Each one is a self-contained package with its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ask-user` | Lets the model ask the user multiple-choice questions instead of guessing. |
| `ava-agent` | Ava autonomous agent harness with session-graph, AST auditor, and reflect-session tooling. |
| `background-terminals` | Run and manage long-lived shell commands (dev servers, watchers, streaming builds) in background terminals. |
| `copy-all` | Bulk-copy agent output to the clipboard. |
| `file-search` | First-class `fd` (file discovery) tool wired into the agent loop. |
| `firecrawl-search` | Firecrawl-powered web search and scraping tool. |
| `git-info` | Surface git status, changed files, and refresh-coordination in the Pi UI. |
| `model-info` | Display model metadata in the bottom bar. |
| `summaries` | Generate and surface session summaries inside the agent transcript. |
| `subagents` | Headless autonomous sub-agents (Pi, Claude, Codex harnesses) with their own context window. |
| `ui-customization` | Customize Pi UI chrome (bottom bar, panels, status indicators). |
| `workflows` | Multi-step workflow runner with sandboxing, artifacts, serialization, and a dashboard view. |

---

## Themes

Two Pi UI themes ship in `themes/`:

- `github-dark-default.json` — the default dark theme modeled on GitHub's dark palette.
- `brutalist.json` — a raw, high-contrast brutalist alternative.

Switch between them via Pi's theme selector.

## Setup

### On your own Pi

Instructions for installing this bundle on a fresh Pi are in [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md). The short version: clone the repo, copy `themes/*.json` into Pi's themes directory, symlink the extensions you want into Pi's `extensions/` directory, and restart Pi.

### For agents

If you are an agent reading this, onboarding instructions are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). System-prompt append layers live in [`APPEND_SYSTEM.md`](APPEND_SYSTEM.md) and [`Translation_Engine_v10_APPEND_SYSTEM.md`](Translation_Engine_v10_APPEND_SYSTEM.md) — read them in order before operating in this repo.

### Skills

Skills are loaded on demand by the Pi agent loop. To make a skill available, ensure its folder is present under `skills/` (it already is, if you cloned this repo) and that Pi's skill discovery is pointed at `skills/`. To find the right skill for a task, start at [`skills/skills-catalog.md`](skills/skills-catalog.md).

## License

The Pi setup code in this repo is provided as-is for the maintainer's personal use. Individual skills under `skills/` ship their own licenses — see each skill's `LICENSE.txt` and `SKILL.md` frontmatter for terms.
